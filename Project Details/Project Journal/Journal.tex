\section{Day 1: Meeting and Project Discussion}

On day 1, the members of the project group had a meeting to discuss how to proceed for the project, and discussed a timeline for the project. The members also discussed the project outline and the tasks that need to be completed. We also discussed the general order of reading the research papers which were assigned to us. The proposed order was as follows,

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07669}{HiPPO: Recurrent Memory with Optimal Polynomial Projections}
    \item \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13985}{LSSM}
    \item \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00396}{S4: Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces}
    \item \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04933}{S5: Simplified State Space Layers for Sequence Modeling}
    \item \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00752}{S6/MAMBA: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces}
\end{enumerate}

But, even before we start reading the research papers, we decided to do some review of RNN and LSTM networks. We decided to watch some youtube videos on the same.
